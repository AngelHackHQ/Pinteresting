#Pinteresting (kinda)

This is my first rails app. I'm building it with the help of One Month Rails, using Sublime editor, my command editor, and GitHub. This is basically a joke to every coder I know... but it's badassery to me :P

I should probably buy private repos so no one can read this and make fun of me...
